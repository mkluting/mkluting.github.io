# Lesson 1: Build a map

## What we're going to do

We're going to be slowly building an adventure game, kind of like Zelda. [Foli](http://warpspire.com/foli/) is a little game I made as an example. Really, the goal here is to experiment.

This first lesson is all about building maps and getting started.

## Getting set up

- Download [this lesson](http://bit.ly/dojo-1) onto your computer

- Create a folder for your project and put the lesson files there

- Download Sublime Text 2 **[for Mac](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.1.dmg)** or **[for Windows](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.1%20Setup.exe)**

- Open up `index.html` in your browser

### Map.js

`map.js` is where we're going to be working today. We've already set a basic template, so we can focus on learning one thing at a time. Today we're going to talk about drawing maps, which is done with **`map.loadData`**.

- Let's change some numbers to see what happens

### Sprites

This all works because of sprites.

Sprites are little squares all squished into one image. We tell the framework which one to use, and it knows how to slice it up.

### Arrays

Arrays are one of the basic building blocks of programming. They're a lot like a list. They can have lots of things in them, like numbers or words.

- `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Kyle"]`

Arrays can even have other arrays inside of them!

```
[
  [0, 1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6, 7]
]
```

For our map, we use arrays to draw each line of the map.

## Your assignment

Now that we've gone over this, I want you to build an island in the water.

## Free time

- [Download our game template](http://bit.ly/dojo-game)

- Move it into your project folder and give it a name

- Open up `game.js` and design your own map!
